    <p><h3>The idea for this website came when i wanted to go the next step above and create the game snake.
        Then I started to mess around with CSS animation, and it became this! The concept originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade, and the ease of implementing Snake has led to hundreds of versions (some of which have the word snake or worm in the title) for many platforms. After a variant was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones in 1998, there was a resurgence of interest in the snake concept as it found a larger audience. There are over 300 Snake-like games for iOS alone.<p></h3>
